                A scope of work acts as a map–guiding the web development

              Adding the right sections is key to creating an effective scope of

                project requirements and lets prospects know you’ve got
                everything under control.

                Project goals clarify what website issues you’re being brought

                launch, or a sales campaign–an important consideration when

                This is where you mention your proposed project fees. Website
                developers either charge an hourly rate or service fees for

                Project assumptions are beliefs that you consider to be true for
                your project to be successful. You anticipate certain events to
                happen during the project lifecycle and therefore make
                assumptions.

              <p id="para">
                For example, a project manager may assume that they will receive
                an approval within two days for each project phase. Now, the
                entire project schedule is based on this assumption. Any changes
                to the assumptions surrounding the approval process will cause a

                Having a solid understanding of potential clients’ expectations
