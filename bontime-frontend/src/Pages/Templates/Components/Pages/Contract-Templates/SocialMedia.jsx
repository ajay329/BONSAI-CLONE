                What Is a Social Media Management Contract?
              </Text>
              <p>
                A social media management contract is a legally binding
                agreement between a social media professional and their client.
                It describes exactly what social media services will be provided
                and protects the rights and interests of both parties.
              </p>
              <p>
                Many social media marketers and managers will work as
                independent contractors or freelancers for a business. This
                means that your contract will also describe the nature of your
                employment, as well as all the requirements and responsibilities
                that come with it. A social media contract template is a little
                different. Basically, this is an easily editable draft version
                of a contract. It’s preloaded with the usual social media
                services you provide, as well as all your required terms and
                conditions for taking on every new job. It comes right after
                your proposal has been agreed to.‍

                Why You Need an Agreement for Social Media Management and
                Marketing
              </Text>
              <p>
                The digital world is constantly growing and social media has
                distinguished itself as an important job in the field of
                marketing. And every important job needs a contract.
              </p>
              <p>
                Managing social media platforms, running campaigns, and
                establishing an online presence are just some of the challenging
                work you’ll do as a social media manager or marketer. Because of
                this, a contract is an assurance towards two main things:
              </p>
              <li className="liP">
                The client recognizes the work you’re doing for them
              </li>
              <li className="liP">They’ve agreed to your payment terms</li>
              <p>
                Of course, there is a lot more a social media contract will do
                for you. Those two points are generally considered the most
                important for many creative entrepreneurs.
              </p>
            </Box>
            <Box id="includedContract">

                What Should Be Included in a Social Media Management Contract?
              </Text>
              <p>
                If you offer social media management services to a client or a
                company, you need a solid contract in place. After all, in a
                world where one ill-judged hashtag could spell disaster, it pays
                to be protected!
              </p>
              <p>
                It also helps to make sure that both parties are on the same
                page when it comes to goals, objectives, and expectations.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, to keep everyone happy and your campaign on track, here’s
                what you need to include in your next social media agreement:
              </p>
              <Text className="subH">Detailed descriptions of the work</Text>
              <p>
                This section is for establishing who you are and what you’re
                going to do for the client. With the help of a brief template,
                you need to be clear about what it is you’re aiming to achieve.
                It’s not enough to just state that you’ll be connecting with the
                target audience and establishing brand loyalty on certain social
                media platforms—be detailed and specific about your
                responsibilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, if the goal is to increase follower numbers, post
                engagement, organic mentions, or even to host a breaching party,
                you should explicitly state each of these responsibilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                A must-have for every social media marketing agreement or
                contract is a list of the resources and information you require
                to successfully launch and run your social media and digital
                marketing campaign. You should also name who’s responsible for
                delivering this info and when you’ll need it. If this is your
                main contact within the company, they may be the person to
                provide you with performance feedback too.
              </p>
              <Text className="subH">Timeline for deliverables</Text>
              <p>
                Next, you’ll need to outline the scope of the project and when
                you’ll be expected to meet certain goals.
              </p>
              <p>
                Remember, don’t be vague. Use numbers and dates when talking
                about timeframes, posting frequency, and your availability
                within the scope of the project.
              </p>
              <p>
                Next, you’ll want to outline the key milestones, dates, and
                deadlines associated with the project. Be clear around when
                something is due and what might affect this.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, if your client is late in delivering login access,
                this could alter your timelines and impact your ability to
                achieve your stated goals.
              </p>

              <Text className="subH">Payment details</Text>
              <p>
                The best social media marketers and managers won’t write a
                single tweet until the payment terms are discussed and agreed
                to.
              </p>
              <p>
                The amount you charge and the method of payment are entirely up
                to you, but if you charge a monthly fee, you may want to include
                performance-related payments as an added incentive. What you
                should definitely include is an upfront deposit, which you’ll
                want to invoice and have paid before the work begins.
              </p>
              <p>
                It’s also a good idea to outline how long a client can take to
                pay your invoices and any fees that may occur from late
                payments.
              </p>
              <Text className="subH">
                Copyright and IP (intellectual property)
              </Text>
              <p>
                If you’re producing content for social media posts or responding
                to tweets, you should state who owns this type of content and
                when ownership is transferred. It may seem arbitrary, but
                consider that this is the client’s final product and their
                intellectual property. It’s important to outline ownership and
                usage permission for legal reasons.
              </p>
              <Text className="subH">Confidentiality</Text>
              <p>
                Next, you’ll want to go into detail about confidential
                information, including a confidentiality clause, a
                non-disclosure agreement (NDA)*, or a non-compete clause.
              </p>
              <p>
                An NDA will benefit both you and the other party by protecting
                trade secrets and any shared personal information.
              </p>
              <p>
                Having a non-compete clause usually means you agree to not work
                with any of the client’s competitors for the duration of the
                contract (and sometimes for a certain period after the contract
                ends).
              </p>
              <Text className="subH">Termination of contract</Text>
              <p>
                All legal documents need a termination clause. This could be on
                a specific date, once a project is finished, or after the final
                payment. Also mention criteria for ending a contract early.
              </p>
              <Text className="subH">Other factors</Text>
              <p>
                Outline a clause around access to your client’s tools. This
                could be the logins to their respective social platforms, their
                Google Analytics account to track KPIs, and any other
                third-party software they may use.
              </p>
              <p>
                It’s also recommended for social media marketers and managers to
                include a clause around the liability of responses on the
                platforms you’re posting on.

                Social Media Management Contract FAQ
              </Text>

                How much should a freelance social media management charge?
              </Text>
              <p>
                As of 2021 in the U.S, a freelance social media manager will
                typically charge between $25-$125+ per hour. This will typically
                depend on your expertise, the scope of a project, what state or
                country you're in, and the client or company involved.
              </p>
              <p>
                Keep in mind, you may need to adjust your rates over the next
                few years. The market growth for social media management is
                expected to rise 23.6% until 2026—and your rates should
                represent this growth too.

                Do I need a contract for a freelance social media manager?
              </Text>
              <p>
                Every freelance social media marketer manager should have a
                contract—it just makes sense, right? You should always have a
                legal document that protects your rights and interests when it
                comes to any project or job, be that social media, digital
                marketing, or any other profession.

                What is a social media partnership agreement?
              </Text>
              <p>
                A partnership agreement in social media means that the client or
                the business becomes a verified “partner” of the social media
                platform. This is usually because they’re recognized as a
                top-quality content producer for that particular platform.
